# Etch-a-Sketch
This is my second project in the the odin project's fundamental javascript course. 

In this project, we were asked to create a square sketchpad with a maximum of 100x100 square grids. The default is set at 16x16 square grid.

There is button that prompt the user to enter the square sketchpad he/she want to genereate, and once that is done, it replaces the default one. The user can now move the mouse cursor over the sketchpad to draw.

This project showcases DOM manipulation, interactive design, and user-friendly features, providing a fun drawing experience
